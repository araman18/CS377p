testFunction:
testl %esi, %esi            - checks the length value passed in the esi register
jle .L4                     -  if this val <= 0 then jump to label 4 since loop doesn't have to be entered
movq %rdi, %rax	            -  move the parameter "input" that was originally in rdi to rax acts as pointer to array
leal -1(%rsi), %edx         -  assigns the value of rsi - 1(last index loop hits) to the edx register.
leaq 4(%rdi,%rdx,4), %rcx   - loads the value (4 + rdi + 4*rdx) into rcx. Moves the first out of bound index into rcx which is compared with rax later to stop the loop.
movl $0, %edx		    - store the value 0 in the register edx, which will be modified within the loop.
.L3:
addl (%rax), %edx	    - the value of the address pointed to by rax is added to edx
addq $4, %rax		    - add 4 to the value of rax
cmpq %rcx, %rax		    - compare the values of rcx and rax and sets flags dependant on result
jne .L3			    - if rax != rcx then go through the loop again.
.L1:
movl %edx, %eax	            - move the value in edx which stores the result into eax which is the return register
ret		            - return the value stored in eax
.L4:
movl $0, %edx 	 	    - move the value of 0 into the register rdx since the length <= 0.
jmp .L1			    - Jump to the label L1 unconditionally


Write a short paragraph giving the big picture of how this code works :

The parameters are passed in rdi and esi, rdi stores the address int* and esi. The first thing that is done is checking if the length stored in esi is 0. If the length
is 0 then we don't need to initialize the loop, so we can jump to L4. L4 just sets the edx register to 0 and jumps to L1, essentially setting the return value to 0 since at L1
the value in edx is moved to rax and then that is returned, so basically if len is 0 we immediatly go to return 0. If the length is not 0, we set up the loop. The starting addr of 
the array initally stored in rdi is moved to rax and that tracks the address as it moves through the array. Then the two lea instructions first get the value of len - 1 which is the last
index of the array. Then it gets the address of the first out of boundds access of the array by computing (4 + rdi + 4*rdx) and storing it in %rcx. rax will be compared to rcx in the future 
to determine when to stop the loop. 0 is then moved to  edx and will be added to during the loop. Then the code enters L3, where the value stored at rax which is the array location we are tracking
is added to edx, this is essentially the same as the line "sum += input[i]". Then the address is incremented by the size of one int which is 4 so rax + 4. Finally, the loop compares rcx and rax, if
rax has reached the first out of bounds index, then the lopp terminates, and moves edx to rax and returns. If not equal then go through the loop again by jumping to L3.




paddd - xmm register is 128 bit and the register has to be in 32 bit register, so first shift first 64 bit and add together
xmm register - setup play with the alignment and process the 128 bit into 32 bit register
movdqu not aligned vs unaligned

Write a short paragraph giving the big picture of how this code works :


The parameters are passed in rdi and esi, rdi stores the address (which is an int pointer for the array) and esi, which is the length of the array. This assembly code unrolls the loop into 4 operation per loop instead of one. 
However, the issue is when the length is not a multiple of 4 you can't unroll the whole loop since at least 4 operations are needed per loop. So instead the assembly code has a code block(L4) which is responsible for the first 4*(x) elements
when x = length/4 in integer division. For instance, if the length of the array is 14 then the first 4 * 3  = 12 elements are processed by L4 and the remaining 2 elements are processed by L3. In the first block of code there is a check to see 
if the length is 0 like in the O1 version of the assembly code, and if it is 0 we instantly jump to L7, then set eax to 0 and return , since nothing needs to accumulated. This code also calculates the last in bounds index and sets the value to eax,
and then the code checks to see if the length is <= 4 in which case it jumps to L3 which is responsible for processing remainder elements. If not it continues to setup for L4. As a part of setting up for L4 the xmm0 register is zeroed with 
xor since the L4 block accumulates it the starting addres is also moved to rax and then the operations in L4 and L3 occur. To go more in depth, L4 uses vector registers xmm0, xmm1, xmm2 which are 128 bit registers and L4 uses xmm0 
to store 4 integers at the same time. Since xmm0 is storing 4 integers at the same time, and is storing the running sum, so at any point in time, xmm0 is storing arr[x], arr[x+4] ,arr[x+8], arr[x+12]. 
That is the reason %rax is being incremented by 16 since each loop in L4 processes 4 integers. The rest of L4 is essentially adding together the 4 integers stored in xmm0 and stores that value in eax. The label L3 is 
used to add up the last remainder elements of the array. There is a check after every index, since you could run out of elements at any point since it is the last x elements of the array.   





Optimizations used in O3 that are not used in O1:
- The most apparent optimization that is used in O3 that is not used in O1 is the loop unrolling. In O3 the loop is unrolled into 4 operations per loop, and there are now 2 label blocks that make up the loop instead of one, this loop unrolling
is accomplished by having one label block deal with the first 4 * x elements of the array where x is the highest multiple of 4 < array length and the remaider elemetns being dealt with by L3. This optimization gets rid of 3/4 of the conditional branches
in the program and the program time decreases at the expense of the size, loop unrolling also reduces the overhead of executing the code that sets up the loop by a large portion.

- Vector registers to accumulate a sum. Since the code is being loop unrolled, that means that 4 elements are being added for each loop iteration, the way the compiler optimizes the 4 add operations per loop is by using 
1 paddd operation with a vector register to simulate the same thing where the vector register xmm0 is able to store 4 integers at the same time and each iteration adds to each of those integers. At the end of the loop contained in L4, 
the rest of L4 is responsible for adding the 4 integers in xmm0 together and store that in eax. This takes times, but for larger values of array length, the time saved by using 1 operation per loop outweights the fixed time it takes to 
assemble xmm0 into eax.

- A small optimization that does occur is in the instruction "testb $3, %sil" where only the 8 least significant bits of rsi are accessed in order to tell if the number is perfectly divisible by 4 instead of accessing the entire rsi register.
